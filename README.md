# Weather-app

## Description:

The name of the app may be a little confusing. The purpose of the app was to learn about connecting to API's from websites and how to make use of them. This app can be used to search air quality stations and see what the air quality is like in those areas.

In order to use it, you simply need to copy it onto your computer, have python installed on your computer and run it.
